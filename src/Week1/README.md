# First week of challenge

## Rules

- Use at most one hour to solve the problem with a timer setup
- Try to solve one problem per day
- Only try with easy ones

##

Always start from the easiest and don't set too big goal, try to crack the small problems in front of you and you may achieve big success you can't imagine at the first place, keep going and enjoy coding!
